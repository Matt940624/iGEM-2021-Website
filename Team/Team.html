        <h2>Team Introduction</h2>
        <h4>We are the Mingdao High School iGEM team, from Taichung, Taiwan. This is our seventh year participating in the iGEM competition, and we are certain that our journey doesn’t stop here! The tradition and legacy will go on!
        </h4>
        <h3>About Our School</h3>
        <h4>Mingdao High School is a private secondary school located in Taichung, Taiwan, it mainly serves 7-12 grade students. The school operates under the International Baccalaureate, a system that is intended to develop students’ intellectual, emotional,
            personal and social skills. For that reason, the school offers countless opportunities for students to explore their interests in different fields, iGEM is of course one of them as it not only improves our intelligence on synthetic biology
            and the entire world, but also other personal and social skills like collaboration, communication, and reflection.
        </h4>
        <h3>About Our Lab</h3>
        <h4>For our facility, we’ve been working in the BioLab located right in our school. First built in 2014 and renovated in 2016, it was designed specifically for genetic engineering, molecular biology, and above all, iGEM. It is well-equipped with,
            providing students with an on-campus opportunity to explore the scientific world.</h4>
